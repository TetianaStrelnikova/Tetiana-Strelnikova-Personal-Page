    <p>     When I was just thinking of changing  my career to programming I was totally lost about the pass I should go...So many languages...So many courses, which are promising you that after a 3 month you will become a Junior...ðŸ˜§ In addition I was so far from programming all my life.. Or not?

    </p><p>     In essence, programming is writing instructions for a computer to execute. When you set (or program) a  temperature and time in your oven, this is also programming.
        
    </p><p>     As a Pharmacist I was reading a "code" (name, doses, frequency of taking the pill and so on) on the prescriptions from doctors and explaining this "code" to the patient. We all know how strange are all this Latin words in the prescriptions.ðŸ˜‚
        
    </p><p>     Basically, programming is about solving problems with code. Programmers have a special way of looking at the problems they have to solve. It can also be used to solve non-computer related problems. The ability to think like a programmer is invaluable in our everyday life.
        
    </p><p>     Understanding this fact gives an answer...In general most of the programming languages are  similar. The difference is in syntax (or in language itself), the concept or the logic of solving the problems is the same.
        
    </p><p>     Unfortunately I did not realize this simple fact at the beginning. When I made my first step I made a mistake. I chose my first <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/" title="SheCodes Foundation Main Page">course </a> by programming language, its popularity and a field where it was used. I chose a programming course in Frontend development, thinking it is a good idea, and I could become a Junior, as they promised. Poor, naÃ¯ve me. ðŸ˜„ The course was really good. I made real life projects (weather app, dictionary, personal page), portfolio ,, but.....
        
    </p><p>     I was just a monkey! I was a smart...but still a monkey! ðŸ™ˆ
        
        vWhen I start to do projects by myself I realized that I did not see the whole picture of the process. I often could not understand where to start.  Why it happened?
        
    </p><p>     In my opinion because I start to learn programming from the tail.
        
    </p><p>     Lets imagine that you need to learn a big system such as a human body. We will see there are major systems include the skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine and so on. 
        
        All the systems are similar in the concept . They are build from cells and controlled by the same structures, neurons, cells of nervous system. All neurons have the same mechanism to influence  organs and cells.
        
        But different systems also use individual structure and peculiarities, tiny and specific. Something like in programming we could use languages, frameworks and methods for specific projects, but the principles  will still be common.
        
        In this case it id better to start from the rules, which are common in all languages.
        
    </p><p>     To learn this principles it is easier to start with the languages which are the most universal...and have free learning lipparies...
        
    </p><p>    <a href="https://www.python.org/" title="Phyton Documentation"> Phyton</a>  the book <a href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/43" title="Read online PDF Think Puthon">Think Phyton</a>  
        
    </p><p>     or <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" title="Javascript mdm web documents ">Javascript</a> (with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" title="mdm web documents HTML">HTML</a>  and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" title="mdm web documents CSS">CSS</a> )
        
    </p><p>     And learn the basics, not the tiny specific projects, as I done. in this case you will kill two rabbits in one shot. You will have a basic understanding of the whole system and a skill to program little projects. 
        
    </p><p>     Have you make the same mistake as me? What are your opinion maybe it was not a mistake?</p>
